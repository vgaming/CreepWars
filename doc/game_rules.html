<span size='x-large' underline='low'>Gold</span>
You get <span color='#FFE680'>gold</span> for each kill. First <b>#gold_kills_to_increase kills</b> give <span color='#FFE680'>#gold_start_p0 gold</span>, next <b>#gold_kills_to_increase kills</b> give <span color='#FFE680'>#gold_start_p1 gold</span>, next <b>#gold_kills_to_increase kills</b> kills give <span color='#FFE680'>#gold_start_p2 gold</span>, etc. Killing Leader counts as 4 creep kills. On 3p FFA map, killing Guard counts as #gold_guard_multiplier leader kills.

<span size='x-large' underline='low'>Shop</span>
You cannot recruit, but you can spend gold in Shop to buy upgrades. Visiting Shop will also heal you.

<span size='x-large' underline='low'>Score</span>
The cost of new AI creeps is equal to your <span color='#FF8080'>score</span>.
You increase <span color='#FF8080'>score</span> with each kill. Only the number of killed units counts (leader kill counts same as creep kill).
Additionally, if your <span color='#FF8080'>score</span> is below <b>#lvl0_barrier</b>, then only lvl0 units will be generated, and if your <span color='#FF8080'>score</span> is above <b>#lvl3plus_barrier</b>, you get random lvl3 unit. If your score is much higher than unit cost, the unit will have additional ''boost''.

<span size='x-large' underline='low'>Other</span>
<b>Guard health</b> increases by 1 when killing a creep and by 3 when killing a leader.
The <b>Scoreboard</b> has the following format: ''<span color='#FF8080'>score</span>  <span color='#FFE680'>gold</span>  (total_kills  leader_kills)''.
